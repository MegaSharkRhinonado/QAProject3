# Welcome to our QA Cinemas React Project!

## Intro
This was a group project utlizing scrum which is a frame for developing, delivering and sustaining products in an agile way, this is by creating sprints from user stories which have must haves broken down from the specification. We created a QA Cinemas website with a Lord of the Rings Theme throughout.

## Getting started
First of all you will need GitBash, MongoDB and an IDE, We as a group used Visual Studio Code. If you would like to create an empty folder on your desktop, right click inside and click GitBash, this will open up a terminal and you can enter the following commands:
```
git init
git clone https://github.com/MegaSharkRhinonado/QAProject3.git
code .
```
This will initialise the folder into a repo, clone down my project and open up all code inside. You have to go into the folder 'megasharkrhinonado' and in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser(If this isn't done automatically).

The page will reload when you make changes.\

#### ALSO 
you will need to enter the backend folder located in 'src' folder and repeat the previous command:
### `npm start`

## Running the tests
For test purposes you can open the code in whatever your preferred IDE is.

## Other Features with npm

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### Built with using technologies
* Visual Studio Code - IDE
* GitBash - Terminal commands to navigate branches
* GitHub - is a code hosting platform used for collboration and version control allowing pull and merge requests to monitor code.
* Jira Board - Used for creating user stories and can be integrated with GitHub to allow commits to assign to a story
* Axios - A router import allowing to create different requests to localhost
* React - This is the foundation of the project, created by facebook to make web development easier by breaking it down into components
* Mocha/Chai - Used for testing methods to ensure they're functioning correctly
