                <p>Locally but quite a trek, is Frodo's pilgrimage from the Shire to Morder to destory the ring, there are multiple choices though if you wish to deviate from his path.</p>

                <p>Frodo of course took the undesirable route however there are more peaceful paths to walk if you don't feel up to the challenge</p>
